				Problem statement (i.e., what is the problem?)

Sometimes people want to improve their musical knowledge or prove their 
musical knowledge to their friends, but they couldn’t find a fun way to do it.

## Comments by Ming
* So this is the 15th of 19 project proposals I've read.  Shockingly this is the first trivia game I've seen in this year's batch.  I mean they've been done before but this will be fun.  Go for it.
